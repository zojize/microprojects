    "In the THE dataset, the dataset provides a `Score_Rank` column that contains the global rank of each school. For our analysis, we want to add a new column called `US_Large_Rank` that contains the ranking of large schools in the United States.  There are several ways to do this, but one of the easiest is to use the `reset_index()` function.\n",

    "There's three observations we can make:\n",

    "- Since the list is already sorted, we know the first university in `df_US_large` is the top university (Rank #1).  The second row is Rank #2, and so on.\n",
    "- If we use `reset_index`, pandas will re-index the rows starting from zero.\n",
    "- The first row is index 0, which will be Rank #1, so we'd just need to add one to all the index values!\n",

    "1. Use `reset_index()` to reset the index values of `df_US_large`,\n",
